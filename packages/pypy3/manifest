# Everyone uses '#!/usr/bin/env python'. Except cgi.py, which uses '#!/usr/local/bin/python'. Their rationale? Python is
# installed to /usr/local/bin by default, and /usr/local/bin is not in PATH on some systems. And if someone installs
# Python in another directory (e.g. distribution maintainers), they probably know what they are doing and can patch
# cgi.py. This logic is sound, except that PyPy maintainers on Dockerhub apparently don't know what they are doing.
#
# This is tracked by https://github.com/docker-library/pypy/issues/71.
